- 👋 Hi, I’m @paveljb
- 👀 I’m interested in ... automation and stocks, still new to the entire computer science scene but hopefully I'll get to a place where I know I am comfortable to code in.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... currently learning selenium via python so I can automate certain admin system tasks so my job is easier (Think ZenDesk or Salesforce)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything that is in my capabilities to colaborate on. Always looking forward to learning from peers who have more experience than me
- 📫 How to reach me ...feel free to contact me via github if that's an option.
